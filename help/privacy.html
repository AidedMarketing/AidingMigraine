                <h4>Privacy First, Always</h4>
                <p>Aiding Migraine was built with privacy as a core principle, not an afterthought. Your migraine data stays on YOUR device, period.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Short Version</h2>

            <p>We know nobody reads long privacy policies, so here's the essential summary:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>✅ Your migraine data never leaves your device</li>
                <li>✅ We don't collect personal health information</li>
                <li>✅ We don't sell, share, or monetize your data</li>
                <li>✅ No account required, no login, no tracking</li>
                <li>✅ Works completely offline</li>
                <li>✅ You can delete everything anytime</li>
            </ul>

            <p>That's it. If you want more details, keep reading.</p>

            <h2>What We Collect</h2>

            <h3>🔔 Notification Preferences (Minimal Server Data)</h3>
            <p>If you enable notifications, we store:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Push subscription token:</strong> Anonymous identifier needed to send notifications</li>
                <li><strong>Notification time:</strong> Your preferred time for daily check-ins (e.g., "8:00 PM")</li>
                <li><strong>Timezone:</strong> Your timezone (e.g., "America/New_York") to deliver notifications at the correct local time</li>
                <li><strong>Enabled status:</strong> Whether notifications are on or off</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Important:</strong> This data is stored on our notification server and is necessary for the notification system to function. However:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The subscription token is generated by your browser/device, not by us</li>
                <li>It's anonymous - not linked to your name, email, or identity</li>
                <li>It cannot be used to identify you personally</li>
                <li>You can delete it anytime by disabling notifications</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>💾 Migraine Data (Local Storage Only)</h3>
            <p>All your migraine tracking data is stored exclusively on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Migraine entries (dates, times, severity, duration)</li>
                <li>Calendar data</li>
                <li>Analytics calculations</li>
                <li>App settings and preferences</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>This data never leaves your device.</strong> It's stored in your browser's local storage and is not transmitted to our servers, cloud services, or third parties.</p>

            <h2>What We Don't Collect</h2>

            <p>Just as important as what we collect is what we <strong>don't</strong> collect:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>❌ <strong>No personal identifying information</strong> (name, email, phone number)</li>
                <li>❌ <strong>No migraine symptoms or health data</strong> (we never see your entries)</li>
                <li>❌ <strong>No location data</strong> (beyond timezone for notification delivery)</li>
                <li>❌ <strong>No analytics or usage tracking</strong> (we don't use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.)</li>
                <li>❌ <strong>No advertising IDs or tracking cookies</strong></li>
                <li>❌ <strong>No browsing history or behavioral data</strong></li>
                <li>❌ <strong>No device fingerprinting</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>

            <h3>✅ Right to Access</h3>
            <p>Your data is stored on your device, accessible anytime. You can view all your migraine entries in the calendar and analytics pages.</p>

            <h3>✅ Right to Export</h3>
            <p>Go to Settings → "Export PDF Report" to generate a comprehensive report of your migraine history. This is your data - export it whenever you want.</p>

            <h3>✅ Right to Delete</h3>
            <p>Delete your data anytime:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Individual entries:</strong> Tap any date on the calendar and delete the entry</li>
                <li><strong>All data:</strong> Settings → "Clear All Data" (permanent - cannot be undone)</li>
                <li><strong>Notification data:</strong> Disable notifications in Settings to remove server-side data</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>✅ Right to Opt-Out</h3>
            <p>Don't want notifications? Simply don't enable them, or disable them in Settings at any time. The app works perfectly fine without notifications.</p>

            <h3>✅ No Account Needed</h3>
            <p>We don't require account creation, so there's no profile to manage or account to delete. Just use the app.</p>

            <h2>Data Storage</h2>

            <h3>📱 Local Storage (On Your Device)</h3>
            <p><strong>What's stored:</strong> All migraine tracking data<br>
            <strong>How long:</strong> Until you delete it or clear your browser data<br>
            <strong>Who has access:</strong> Only you (via your device)</p>

            <h3>🔔 Notification Server (Our Servers)</h3>
            <p><strong>What's stored:</strong> Push subscription token, notification time, timezone<br>
            <strong>How long:</strong> Until you disable notifications or the token expires<br>
            <strong>Who has access:</strong> Only our notification service (not shared with third parties)<br>
            <strong>Location:</strong> Hosted on Render.com servers</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

            <p>Aiding Migraine uses minimal third-party services:</p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Service</th>
                    <th>Purpose</th>
                    <th>Data Shared</th>

                    <td>None (static file hosting)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p><strong>We do NOT use:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google Analytics or similar tracking</li>
                <li>Social media pixels (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)</li>
                <li>Advertising networks</li>
                <li>Data brokers or third-party data sharing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Security</h2>

            <p>We take security seriously:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTTPS encryption:</strong> All communication between the app and our servers is encrypted</li>
                <li><strong>No passwords:</strong> No account = no password to leak</li>
                <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> Your migraine data never travels over the network, so it can't be intercepted</li>
                <li><strong>Open source:</strong> Our code is publicly available for security review</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Your responsibility:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep your device locked with a passcode/biometric</li>
                <li>Don't share your device with untrusted people</li>
                <li>Keep your operating system and browser updated</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

            <p>Aiding Migraine is designed for adults with migraines. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has used Aiding Migraine, please <a href="mailto:support@aidingmigraine.com">contact us</a>.</p>

            <p>However, since we don't collect personal identifying information and data is stored locally, there's minimal privacy risk even if a minor uses the app with parental consent.</p>

            <h2>Data Sharing</h2>

            <p><strong>We do not sell, rent, or share your data. Ever.</strong></p>

            <p>The only "sharing" that happens is when YOU choose to export a PDF and share it with your doctor - which is entirely under your control.</p>

            <p>We will never:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sell your data to advertisers, data brokers, or third parties</li>
                <li>Share your migraine information with insurance companies</li>
                <li>Provide your data to researchers without explicit consent</li>
                <li>Use your data for marketing purposes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
            <p>Because we don't collect personal health information, there's essentially nothing to provide even if legally compelled. The only data on our servers is anonymous notification preferences, which cannot identify you.</p>

            <h2>International Users</h2>

            <p>Aiding Migraine can be used anywhere in the world. Since migraine data is stored locally on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No international data transfer of health information</li>
                <li>Compliant with GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), and other privacy regulations</li>
                <li>Notification server hosted in the United States (via Render.com)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you're in the EU: You have all GDPR rights (access, deletion, portability) as described in the "Your Rights" section above.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

            <p>If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Update the "Last updated" date at the top</li>
                <li>Show a notice in the app for 30 days</li>
                <li>Post the updated policy to this page</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Significant changes (like adding data collection) would require explicit opt-in consent.</p>

            <h2>Open Source</h2>

            <p>Aiding Migraine is open source, meaning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can review the code to verify our privacy claims</li>
                <li>Security researchers can audit the app</li>
