UX: Consolidate weather displays into single migraine-friendly indicator

Removed redundant weather information to reduce cognitive load:

**What Changed:**
1. Removed detailed "Current Conditions" card (was above pain selector)
2. Kept only simple forecast indicator (moved to top, before pain selector)
3. Removed 80+ lines of unused CSS
4. Simplified JavaScript function (removed references to old elements)

**New Structure:**
```
Log New Episode
  [Weather Forecast Indicator] ← Only shows if significant change or clear
  Pain Intensity [0-10]
  Optional Details...
```

**Migraine-Friendly Benefits:**
- ✅ One simple message instead of two weather sections
- ✅ Context before action (see "Weather May Be a Factor" THEN log pain)
- ✅ Less visual clutter and cognitive load
- ✅ Glanceable information (2 states: clear or warning)
- ✅ Auto-hides when no data (no "enable this" prompts during pain)

**Code Cleanup:**
- Removed weather-info-card, weather-header, weather-stats CSS (unused)
- Removed weather-stat, weather-label, weather-value CSS (unused)
- Removed weather-unit, weather-trend, weather-alert CSS (unused)
- Simplified updateLogWeatherDisplay() from 70 lines to 40 lines

Version: 1.7.3 → 1.7.4

Someone experiencing a migraine now sees ONE clear piece of weather context
instead of multiple detailed displays competing for their attention.
